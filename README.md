# Lab02_Unit-Testing_C-Storm

## Unit Testing in C# with Bank ATM Console Application

## What is this??

1. This project is a lab to work on TDD (Test Driven Development) using C#; a console application that mocks the functionality of an ATM. Users are able to make deposits, withdrawls, view balance, and receive a printed transaction history.

2. This project is a simple console application with all functionality happening through the terminal.

3. To use this application, simple run the program on your local machine. Be aware that your account balance at the start of the program is always $0, so you must make a deposit before you can withdraw!

4. Relevant details: This is my first time working with unit testing in c#, I only recently began using the language a couple days ago, so it's a little rough around the edges, but it was fun to figure out! 

5. Technologies used: C#, .NET, Xunit
